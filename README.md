# JIRA To Hours

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomav/jira-remaining-to-hours.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomav/jira-remaining-to-hours)

This extension allows to translate "1w 2d 3h 4m" to "59" hours, which can be useful when moving estimation from time to effort and your JIRA configuration cannot be changed easily.

This extension will only work SAAS version of JIRA on *.atlassian.net.

This extension is WIP and is not published to store yet.

## Having question?

Just create an issue.
